## Project Overview

SustainaGraph is an interactive network visualization website created to provide a visual exploration of the evolution of corporate sustainability research spanning from 1973 to 2019. This project is based on a scientometric analysis of 26,111 Web of Science articles, encapsulating the continuous development and shifts in the conceptual foundations of corporate sustainability over 47 years. The visualization segments the research evolution into four major periods: the Dawn of Diverse Ideas (1979-2005), the Rise of Conceptual Frameworks (2006-2011), the Era of Heterogeneity (2012-2015), and the Age of Stakeholder Engagement (2016-2019).

## Features

- **Interactive Network Visualization:** Explore the connections, trends, and shifts in corporate sustainability research across different periods.
- **Period-wise Analysis:** Delve into each defined period to understand the leading research subjects, theories, and perceptions in corporate sustainability.
- **Emerging Concepts Highlight:** Discover emerging concepts in recent sustainability research and their significance in addressing current challenges faced by practitioners.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/entelecheia/sustaina-graph.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sustaina-graph
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Test the project:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
    See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

6. Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
