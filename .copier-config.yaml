project_description: 'SustainaGraph is an interactive network visualization website
    created to provide a visual exploration of the evolution of corporate sustainability
    research spanning from 1973 to 2019. This project is based on a scientometric
    analysis of 26,111 Web of Science articles, encapsulating the continuous development
    and shifts in the conceptual foundations of corporate sustainability over 47 years.
    The visualization segments the research evolution into four major periods: the
    Dawn of Diverse Ideas (1979-2005), the Rise of Conceptual Frameworks (2006-2011),
    the Era of Heterogeneity (2012-2015), and the Age of Stakeholder Engagement (2016-2019).'
