This project is based on a scientometric analysis of 26,111 Web of Science articles, encapsulating the continuous development and shifts in the conceptual foundations of corporate sustainability over 47 years. The visualization segments the research evolution into four major periods: the Dawn of Diverse Ideas (1979-2005), the Rise of Conceptual Frameworks (2006-2011), the Era of Heterogeneity (2012-2015), and the Age of Stakeholder Engagement (2016-2019).</p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li>Interactive Network Visualization: Explore the connections, trends, and shifts in corporate sustainability research across different periods.</li> <li>Period-wise Analysis: Delve into each defined period to understand the leading research subjects, theories, and perceptions in corporate sustainability.</li> <li>Emerging Concepts Highlight: Discover emerging concepts in recent sustainability research and their significance in addressing current challenges faced by practitioners.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Clone the repository:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/entelecheia/sustaina-graph.git\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the project directory:</p> <pre><code>cd sustaina-graph\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install dependencies:</p> <pre><code>npm install\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Run the project:</p> <pre><code>npm start\n</code></pre> <p>The application will be running on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test the project:</p> <pre><code>npm test\n</code></pre> <p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\\ See the section about running tests for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build the project:</p> <pre><code>npm run build\n</code></pre> <p>Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder.
